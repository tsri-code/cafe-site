# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief. It implements the use of BEM regulations, animation effects, transitions on top of other basic HTML and CSS capabilities (such as flex-box and positioning).

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Ideas for improvement would be:

1. A Database. Adding a databse would increase the functionality of the website, showing that the frontend design features can be put into practice by actually storing the 'Book a Table' information the users place.

2. Another feature could be adding a section for placing a to-go order. With a restaurant this pristine and popular users should be able to place an order to-go, adding a section that allows for picking menu items, a pickup time, and displaying the order total would really complete this website.
